## Some info
There are three scripts defined in the __package.json__ file : 
*   `webpack-dev-server-start` for testing mdc styles (Material Design Library) used in this app ui ; 
*   `webpack-build` for using the built `bundle.css` & `bundle.js` directly from the HTML markup. ; 
*   `test-app` for running the app from npm.

## About the app
**Ringer** is a *cross-platform* **(at least my target is that)** instant messaging app currently being built using some awesome open-source technologies.
